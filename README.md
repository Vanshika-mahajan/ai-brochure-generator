# AI-Powered Brochure Generator üöÄ

This project is a full-stack web application that automatically generates a professional company brochure from a single URL. It intelligently scrapes, analyzes, and summarizes website content using AI and NLP models, then assembles it into a downloadable PDF.



## Features ‚ú®

-   **Intelligent Web Crawling:** Navigates websites to find and scrape content from key pages (e.g., "About Us", "Services").
-   **AI Content Classification:** Uses a Hugging Face Zero-Shot model to understand the purpose of each page.
-   **Automated Summarization & QA:** Leverages NLP models to create concise summaries and extract key offerings.
-   **Image & Logo Detection:** Automatically identifies and extracts the company logo and other relevant images.
-   **Dynamic PDF Generation:** Assembles all extracted data into a clean, professional PDF brochure.
-   **Robust Fallback System:** If intelligent classification fails, it defaults to using all scraped text to ensure a brochure is always created.
-   **Web Interface:** Simple and clean front end built with Flask to provide a user-friendly experience.
